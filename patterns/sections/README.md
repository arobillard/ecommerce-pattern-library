information-section:
  padding: '1.5rem 0'
  desc: |
    The information section is used to highlight an upcoming event or a group on the home page.
---
Sections can also be combined with section colour classes including `section-highlight-light` and `section-highlight-medium` which help differentiate them on a singular page. If only one section is on the page, use `section-highlight-light`. If there are multiple in a row, use `section-highlight-light`, then a `<section>` without the class `section-highlight`, then a `section-highlight-medium`, rotating through as needed.
