The buttons use the primary colour to highlight the buttons, allowing them to stand out.

- The primary button is to be used in standard sections and after large blocks of text.
- The secondary buttons are for coloured backgrounds or to create contrast for emphasis.
- The ghost button is used on banners and cards.

Buttons can be combined with `font-size` classes to make different sized buttons.
